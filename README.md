Project Title: When is the best time to visit the major cities in Canada domestically

Team members: Gustavo Cupertino, Varun Vinodh, Bhuvana Krish, and Tina Saravi


Project description/outline
The purpose of this project is to figure out the time period within a year is the best time to visit the four major cities; Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax in Canada. Based on the weather conditions, tourism activities, flight cancellations and delays, and flight prices. 


Research questions to answer
What dates in a year do more flights get canceled/delayed due to extreme weather patterns?
What season do we have more visitors to Canada ?
Which month is the cheapest flight to visit the cities relative to the ten year data frame?
Are prices higher during periods of higher tourism traffic? 


Datasets to be used
Flight cancellations and delays major airports in the cities
Amount of visitors to the cities 
Weather patterns for the cities 2015-2020 (parameters: temp and precip):https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html
Airlines Traffic Passenger Statistics: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airlines-traffic-passenger-statistics
Average domestic fares for Canada and ten major cities, quarterly: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2310023701

 

Rough breakdown of tasks 

Task 1: find the datasets listed above 

Task 2: clean and prepare the datasets 

Task 3: merge the datasets to find correlations between each

Task 4: analyze the data to see if the research questions can be answered or figure any biases within the dataset

Task 6: prepare visualization of the datasets 

Task 6: create powerpoint with the data information for the presentation



Current Task Being Worked On:
Tina: Weather
Bhuvana: Weather
Varun: Visitors
Gustavo: flight cancellations/delays and flight prices
